CAN protocol communication using Beaglebone Black
This is a simple code for CAN communication over a CAN bus using Beaglebone Black
The TX pin (P9-26) and RX pin (P9-24) are connected to a CAN transceiver (VP231) and they are commonly grounded for a common reference voltage.
This code was used to communicate with arduino due over a CAN bus
